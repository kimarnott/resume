    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I have always found myself looking for efficiencies and optimisations in my work. Although my education was in aerospace engineering, 
        in which I completed a master’s degree, I discovered that my inclination for automation fit the digital space like a glove. 
        I transitioned to the data department upon completion of my graduate scheme and have not looked back. As a newly minted member of the data team, 
        I learned how to use PostgreSQL, an activity I enjoyed so much that I decided to dedicate my free time to learning other common languages such Python, 
        HTML, and JavaScript. I am hoping to continue developing these skills in a professional setting, using them to produce useful, user-friendly, and robust resources.

    <!-- <h2>Skills</h2>
    <h3>Software Development</h3>
    <p>As a data engineer, I have enjoyed learning and interacting with PostgreSQL and low-code/no-code websites to create data frameworks and front-end UI
         for business-critical processes such as waste management, NCRs, and vacancy management. 
         These all received positive praise from stakeholders and enthusiastic user uptake.</p> 
    <p>I am undertaking online learning in my own time to improve my skills in Python, and learn other languages. Although finding the time is sometimes a challenge, 
        I am enjoying developing my skills immensely.</p>
    <h3>Leadership and Collaboration</h3>
    <p>As an engineer, I often lead and join discussions with stakeholders to extract, formalise, and verify requirements. Most notably for an AI document library.
        I provide suport and mentorship to other members of my team.
    </p>
    <p>As a data engineer, I have worked with product owners to prioritise work packages and word appropriate user stories.</p>

    <h3>Verification and Validation</h3>
    <p>As a data engineer, I set aside time to create unit and system tests for patch releases to ensure system integrity.</p>
    <p>As a systems engineer, I helped develop and coordinated the user acceptance testing cycles for a new non-conformance reporting management toolkit and 
        was heavily involved in managing the proceeding engineering outcomes.</p>
