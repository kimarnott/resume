            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>
                I have always found myself looking for efficiencies and optimisations in my work. Although my education was in aerospace engineering, 
                in which I completed a master’s degree, I discovered that my inclination for automation fit the digital space like a glove. 
                I transitioned to the data department upon completion of my graduate scheme and have not looked back. As a newly minted member of the data team, 
                I learned how to use PostgreSQL, an activity I enjoyed so much that I decided to dedicate my free time to learning other common languages such Python, 
                HTML, and JavaScript. I am hoping to continue developing these skills in a professional setting, using them to produce useful, user-friendly, and robust resources.
